 also topup airtime by phone number who registered in this program while we add the customer to the system and etc.
 The  steps we use in this program is first we add the employer on banking system by getting help from the manager of bank and
 then by using employer username and password we add a customer by using manual banking system option that exist in bellow and
 finally by using customer phone number and account number we can create ATMcard and also we can create CBEbirr for the customer.

 ATMcard() and  CBEbirr(). This banking management system project is free from interest.In addition to the above one when we use the same account number,
